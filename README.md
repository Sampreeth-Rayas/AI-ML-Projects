# Plant-growth-estimator-for-hydroponics
Masters Project: Development of a machine learning plant growth estimator for hydroponics Three Approaches of coming up with a plant growth estimator were developed and tested. First method was the traditional machine learning approach where a feature extractor was designed using a combination of Gabor flites, morphological operators, Sobel filter and a classification algorithms (SVM and XGBOost). The second approach was using the transfer learning models. Third approach was using a pretrained network as a feature extractor then use a machine learning model SVM of XGBoost for classification. Method 1 is the machine learning method with no morphological operators of opening and closing. Method 2 is the machine learning method with morphological operators, Transfer learning models used are VGG16, VGG19 and RESNET-50 VGG16, VGG19 and RESNET-50 combined with SVM and XGBoost in different models.

Execution Time is measured in all the experiments. The conclusion from these experiments is that the third approach of using the convolutional layers of a pretrained model and a classification algorithm produces the best results in terms of prediction time and accuracy.
